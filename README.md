# McDonald's Location/Food API

Use the API to view the menu of McDonald's, and in the future find locations near you.

## Requirements

- Any version of Python 3


## Usage

This can be used in an interpreter or in python scripts. For example, I will be using this in the [WiiLink24](https://github.com/WiiLink24) revival of the Demae Channel. Grabbing the json of
any menu category is super simple.

```python
import menu

menu.beef()
menu.mccafe()
```
etc.

I am currently working on converting the store locator.
